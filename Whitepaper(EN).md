### <div align="center">Abstract</div>
Valireum is a Blockchain based ecosystem utilizing the Ethereum network to deliver innovative solutions to the gaming industry. Our platform aims to support Developers, Consumers and Investors with new incentives that fundamentally change the way value is created and shared. With Valireum, developers are assited with the tools to create and deploy large-scale games without the overhead costs and risks involved with a traditional development studio. WE cator to industry professionals and novice user in a way that is both user friendly while producing quality products. Investors in Valireum can enjoy new pipeline options of revenue, with a variety of options that allow for better diversification, efficiency and control of targetted asset specifics. Valireum will also redifine the role of the consumer - broadening oppotunities in a way that rewards them for their participation. In addition, through tokenization and smart contracts Valireum will leverge such technology to create a direct revenue marketplace for digital assets that it's community can create, trade and share. 

The Valireum platform will consist of "Planets" which represent the canvis of new games and idea for Developers and users to freely build upon. These Planits can be purchased with the use of the Valireum Token VLM - a non fungible and transferrable token stored in an Ethereum smart contract. Planets can be leased and rented out by investors, or Traded and sold to anyone, to be used as the foundation layer for games and assets built on it. In addition to Planets, each game created on these planets will have the option for users to also tokenize smaller virtual assets utilized within the games. Both items and planets will populate a decentalized marketplace with the support of secure ownership and trensferal. 

As the gaming industry rapidly grows and expands, consumer demand for greater quality comes with it. The definition of such quality comes in many forms - the level of immersion with graphics, fairness and meaningful challenge in gameplay, and social connectedness of larger micro-communities. These trends have influenced the way game studios make decisions on how to balance greater expectations with risk and revenue strategies. The fact is, the industry core dynamics have been changing dramatically, from traditional consumer/product exchange markets, to consumer/consumer exchange markets that leverage the product. In several cases we are now seeing consumers on the payroll of studios with network marketing and content creators. Gamers are making a career of streaming, alongside widely sponsored 'eSport' events. Much has changed in the way money, goods and services exchange in the gaming industry - and providing a more efficient strategy to meet these changes is in critical need. 

What Valireum aims to achieve, is an Intelligent approach to the modern day gaming industry - addressing a vast range of complications from asset security, development efficiency, risk management, investor options and customization, and new incentives for all participants. We wish to deliver a no-compromise approach that creates a better deal and greater value for Consumers, Developers and Investors alike. With the power of Blockchain, and smarter applications to monitization of gaming, we believe we have the answer. 

What is the future of gaming? Valireum.

# **Section B: Our Technology**
## 1. The Network & Infastructure

- Scalable database, notification system, API event/triggers.

AWS (Amazon Web Services) is a comprehensive, evolving cloud computing platform provided by Amazon that includes a mixture of infrastructure as a service (IaaS), platform as a service (PaaS) and packaged software as a service (SaaS) offerings.
 AWS services can offer an organization tools such as compute power, database storage and content delivery services.

How AWS works

AWS is separated into different services; each can be configured in different ways based on the user's needs. AWS can also be used for game development and AR & VR (Augmented reality and virtual reality). 
AWS offers augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) development tools through the Amazon Sumerian service. Amazon Sumerian allows users to create AR and VR applications without needing to know programming or create 3D graphics. The service also enables users to test and publish applications in-browser. 
Amazon Sumerian can be used in:
 • 3D web applications
 • E-commerce & sales applications
 • Marketing
 • Online education
 • Manufacturing
 • Training simulations
 • Gaming
Game development
Large game developing companies, such as UBISOFT, will use AWS services for their games, like “For Honor”. 
AWS can provide services for each part of a game's lifecycle.


For example, AWS will provide a developer back-end services, analytics and developer tools. Developer tools help aid developers in making their game, while back-end services might be able to help with building, deploying or scaling a developer's platform. Analytics might help developers better know their customers and how they play the game.  Developers can also store data, or host game data on AWS servers.
With Amazon handing bandwidth and the cloud, you can focus on making beautiful environments and compelling characters with fun, engaging storylines.Technical artists will find a suite of tools at their disposal including physically-based shaders, dynamic global illumination, particle effects, and volumetric fog.)

## 2. V-editor for Developers
V-Editor: Game developing tool that can update your game world in real-time.

## 3. Engine Support

Unreal Engine is one of the leading game engines used in the gaming industry with Unreal engine 4 of being the most prominent and widely-used Game Engine developed by Epic Games. 

Unreal Engine has proved its worth in multiple genres and styles of games over the years. In Unreal Tournament, Gears of War, Fortnite - this is where Unreal Engine excels.
Is also great for large-scale games, as demonstrated by its standing as a mainstay of AAA development, Unreal scales well to larger teams and games with a lot of content. Photorealism is one of the reasons why is widely used outside of games too, in sectors such as architecture, product design, and filmmaking. The UE4 is supported by a wide range of features and tools, within an intuitive editor that is accessible to many disciplines.
Its tools provides solutions for pretty much every macro task you'll have to address: scene layout including landscape and foliage, cinematics, visual scripting, particle system, animation network, materials creation, lightmapping, asset management, level of details, physics, basic bricks of AI, performance and memory tracking tools for optimisation. 
The texturing and materials tools in Unreal are second to none. 
There are also tools built in that makes building for virtual or augmented reality a lot easier, thank to performance tracking. 
Unreal is very powerful and combines reach, technical sophistication with flexibility. 
The ability to have access to the entire C++ source code for the engine and modify it to your needs is one of the reasons UE4 is so flexible. It is important if we take into consideration the fact that C++, alongside Java, is the most used engine in game development. 

In addition to being flexible, UE4 allows for quick prototyping and iteration, which is useful when starting a new project. Is made simple for non-technical staff by its visual scripting system, Blueprint.

With more than 7.5 million developers using Unreal - according to Epic CEO Tim Sweeney at GDC 2019 - it is one of the most popular game engines.

Projects built in Unreal Engine 4 will be compatible with (and can be moved to) Unreal Engine 5 when it launches in 2021.
