### <div align="center">Abstract</div>

<div align="center">The Gaming Industry is growing increasingly larger and faster each day, not just in user base but also on the development side. Gaming is an evolving industry that overtime has redifined the role of 'what is a gamer' and 'what is a game' with new supportive platforms like Twich, Youtube, and 'eSport' events that have made possible a viable career path for gamers to turn a recreational passion into a thriving business and occupation. We can identify that it is complimentary services within the Gaming Industry that have been a strong driving factor in influencing this change. At the core of these services are new opportunities that change the landscape of monetization, whereby the boundary between Gamers and Devlopers have somewhat blended together more. Devlopment studios are partnering with popular gamers for marketing services, gamers are talking to devlopers in large scale events which influence what is being created in a more direct manner. The trend here is that devlopers are becoming more interconnected with gamers no longer as a purely supplier/consumer relationship, but a two-way dependancy for shared wealth and creative control.

This is where the Valireum Platform comes in. We see this dynamic shift in the industry and with it comes new challenges, complications, and opportunities that the old model is somewhat lagging with compatability. As mentioned, new service platforms have been a key driving force in evolving the industry and it's applications. However the current services fail to provide support to the wider consumer base and devlopers. While content strewams and professional gamers have been well supported, this only accounts for a small minority of the available potential that is yet to be leveraged. 

What Valireum offers, is a platform service that supports any and all developers, and every user and gamer. Irrespective of trying to secure funding for your project, or placing yourself in the limited spotlight - Valireum rewards everyone with the redistribution of value from attention, and in an automated and secure way with zero risk. We achieve this by harnessing the power of Blockchain Technology - namely, the Ethereum Blockchain and the functionality of Smart Contracts with Tokinization of Assets. 

The current ecosystem is complex - Investors are holding risk as they buy into Medium to Large scaled Development studios. These studios bankroll the costs and then launch it all as a single packaged game, hoping for the success to follow from it. Some games achieve that success, and many more do not. Games studios are forced to offset and balance their winners with their losers, and this inturn has a direct impact on the companies investors. In addition to this, the consumer has been met with increasingly greater costs in order to support more complex and elaborate games. Many are spending much more these days not only on the initial product, but even more on virtual assets or features that are added to the game thereon. For one example, one of the worlds most popular FPS games - 'Counter Strike: Global Offensive', initially retailed for $40 USD, and is now completely free to own, however individual gamers are spending anywhere from $200 to $20,000 on cosmetic virtual items. The value of the items within games, have now become a core focus as these items overtake the revenue of the intial game sales. 

So changes to the monetization of games in this way have created problems and opportunities on both sides of the isle. Children are participating in a psedo-stock market with real money at risk. Account security and thus virtual assets are not sufficiently protecting gamers from significant losses. Cross-boarder money launduring schemes have also taken advantage of these changes. On this side of issues, Valireum deployes Blockchain technology that will protect consumers assets via tokenization of items, full encryption protection, and complete tracking history through the blockchain ledger technology. We see this as a vital need for the emerging industry that the power of Blockchain can serve as a unique, targetted and full proof solution for the games and gamers of tomorrow. 
 
For gamers, securing the value of virtual items is one important matter, but another is to provide greater opportunity in regards to creating and recivieving wealth. Games are becoming more expensive - to develop, to purchase, and to update. The bottem layer foundation supporting all of this are the consumers. Initially investors float development, and they are incentivized to do so by the return on investment that gamers provide. What Valireum also creates, is a pipeline back to the gamers. Essentially our Platform will reward all gamers for merely participating and doing what they do normally. All of this process is once again autnomously controlled through the power of Blockchain and Smart Contracts. As a gamer, you get rewarded for your time - this is a significant change to the current ecosphere that exclusively rewards a minority of participants like streamers and professional eSport players. This acts an a powerful incentive to attract more users - get paid to play. 

As mentioned above, the definitions of gamers and developers are starting to cross-over and mix. Indeed we already see that the larger wealth in gaming has shifted to community created content like virtual items, while game studios are playing a more reduced role in providing the 'meeting place' attraction. That is, they present a 'Candy Store' and charge an entry fee, yet players are stocking the shop with their own candy, and buying and selling to each other. This change has somewhat been a hard blow to developers and investors as it has forced them to adapt in a way that significant effects the games quality. For example, selling in-game items or benifits that gives a player an advantage over others. This is commonaly refered to as the "Pay to Win" model VS the "Free to Play" alternative. Yes some games do a fairly good job of trying to balance this element, but the risk of imbalance is discouragement of participation. In short, players want fairness in gameplay, but game studios also need to pay bills. Again, this is where Valireum steps in and provides a Win-Win model. 



------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Valireum achieves this through the democratisation of game development and deployment, allowing developers to bring their vision to life quickly, without costs. 
Valireum treats game developers as partners and offers a complete solution to build games from scratch with free hosting services to kickstart. If the game is successful Valireum hosting services will scale, and unlike other providers, the Valireum platform will pay the developers loyalties for each new player connected to the game.

It will provide a wealth of templates, tools and a state-of-the-art infrastructure for game developers to build their own games. Fully decentralized, autonomous games where players have provably fair gameplay with true ownership of their in-game items.
Until now scaling has been a major difficulty for blockchains and particularly for massive game worlds and their virtual asset creations. 
Since Valireum world is distributed in form of non-fungible tokens(NFT) in the Ethereum blockchain, this means anyone holding a token has a instant access to all the services that Valireum provides. 

Furthermore, developers can fully leverage the Valireum Universe to create their own Ecosystems and currency that can be traded easily in ......................???????? 


Cryptocurrency and blockchain technology are  having a significant impact on the gaming sector, which is expected to become a $154 bilion global industry by 2021. That is why it can be said that the gaming industry is one of the fastest growing tech industries in the world. The potential of cryptocurrency technologies in games is practically untapped and we are only starting! 
We see the blockchain as a transformational technology where games transcend the virtual and take on a life of their own in the real world.
Just like in the world of finance where investors require a safe environment to carry out their transactions, gamers require a safe platform to develop their own games. 
What we proposed  is gaming using the blockchain to provide a secure, decentralised, autonomous, and flexible platform upon which a variety of games and projects can be built. Valireum is the world’s first fully capable decentralized virtual ecosystem meant to help game creators, developers, realize and distribute their vision. 
 
 Nowadays, the online gaming development, hosting and management is limited to large scale game studios, even if you are a skilled game developer, you won't be able to host and manage your game without paying a high monthly fee to third-party services that have no guarantee of success, in other words, if your game succeeds the service provider will happily scale and get more profit, if not you are the only one whos losing money.

Valireum treats game developers as partners and offers a complete solution to build games from scratch with free hosting services to kickstart, if the game is successful Valireum hosting services will scale, and unlike other providers, the Valireum platform will pay the developers loyalties for each new player connected to the game.

The Valireum world is distributed in form of non-fungible tokens(NFT) in the Ethereum blockchain which means anyone holding a token has a instant access to all the services that Valireum provides. these tokens will be sold to investors during the public offer later when the beta version is released.</div>

# **Section B: Our Technology**
## 1. The Network 

- Scalable database, notification system, API event/triggers.

AWS (Amazon Web Services) is a comprehensive, evolving cloud computing platform provided by Amazon that includes a mixture of infrastructure as a service (IaaS), platform as a service (PaaS) and packaged software as a service (SaaS) offerings.
 AWS services can offer an organization tools such as compute power, database storage and content delivery services.

How AWS works

AWS is separated into different services; each can be configured in different ways based on the user's needs. AWS can also be used for game development and AR & VR (Augmented reality and virtual reality). 
AWS offers augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) development tools through the Amazon Sumerian service. Amazon Sumerian allows users to create AR and VR applications without needing to know programming or create 3D graphics. The service also enables users to test and publish applications in-browser. 
Amazon Sumerian can be used in:
 • 3D web applications
 • E-commerce & sales applications
 • Marketing
 • Online education
 • Manufacturing
 • Training simulations
 • Gaming
Game development
Large game developing companies, such as UBISOFT, will use AWS services for their games, like “For Honor”. 
AWS can provide services for each part of a game's lifecycle.


For example, AWS will provide a developer back-end services, analytics and developer tools. Developer tools help aid developers in making their game, while back-end services might be able to help with building, deploying or scaling a developer's platform. Analytics might help developers better know their customers and how they play the game.  Developers can also store data, or host game data on AWS servers.
With Amazon handing bandwidth and the cloud, you can focus on making beautiful environments and compelling characters with fun, engaging storylines.Technical artists will find a suite of tools at their disposal including physically-based shaders, dynamic global illumination, particle effects, and volumetric fog.)

## 2. V-editor for Developers
V-Editor: Game developing tool that can update your game world in real-time.

## 3. Engine Support

Unreal Engine is one of the leading game engines used in the gaming industry with Unreal engine 4 of being the most prominent and widely-used Game Engine developed by Epic Games. 

Unreal Engine has proved its worth in multiple genres and styles of games over the years. In Unreal Tournament, Gears of War, Fortnite - this is where Unreal Engine excels.
Is also great for large-scale games, as demonstrated by its standing as a mainstay of AAA development, Unreal scales well to larger teams and games with a lot of content. Photorealism is one of the reasons why is widely used outside of games too, in sectors such as architecture, product design, and filmmaking. The UE4 is supported by a wide range of features and tools, within an intuitive editor that is accessible to many disciplines.
Its tools provides solutions for pretty much every macro task you'll have to address: scene layout including landscape and foliage, cinematics, visual scripting, particle system, animation network, materials creation, lightmapping, asset management, level of details, physics, basic bricks of AI, performance and memory tracking tools for optimisation. 
The texturing and materials tools in Unreal are second to none. 
There are also tools built in that makes building for virtual or augmented reality a lot easier, thank to performance tracking. 
Unreal is very powerful and combines reach, technical sophistication with flexibility. 
The ability to have access to the entire C++ source code for the engine and modify it to your needs is one of the reasons UE4 is so flexible. It is important if we take into consideration the fact that C++, alongside Java, is the most used engine in game development. 

In addition to being flexible, UE4 allows for quick prototyping and iteration, which is useful when starting a new project. Is made simple for non-technical staff by its visual scripting system, Blueprint.

With more than 7.5 million developers using Unreal - according to Epic CEO Tim Sweeney at GDC 2019 - it is one of the most popular game engines.

Projects built in Unreal Engine 4 will be compatible with (and can be moved to) Unreal Engine 5 when it launches in 2021.
