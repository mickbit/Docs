### <div align="center">Abstract</div>

<div align="center">Nowadays, the online gaming development, hosting and management is limited to large scale game studios, even if you are a skilled game developer, you won't be able to host and manage your game without paying a high monthly fee to third-party services that have no guarantee of success, in other words, if your game succeeds the service provider will happily scale and get more profit, if not you are the only one whos losing money.

Valireum treats game developers as partners and offers a complete solution to build games from scratch with free hosting services to kickstart, if the game is successful Valireum hosting services will scale, and unlike other providers, the Valireum platform will pay the developers loyalties for each new player connected to the game.

The Valireum world is distributed in form of non-fungible tokens(NFT) in the Ethereum blockchain which means anyone holding a token has a instant access to all the services that Valireum provides. these tokens will be sold to investors during the public offer later when the beta version is released.</div>
